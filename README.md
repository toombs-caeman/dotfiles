a grab bag of stuff that personalizes my computers

# Overview

arch + swaywm + kitty + zsh + neovim

Semantically sway and vim have a bit of overlap in the 'arranging tiles' department so sway gets the Meta key and vim gets the alt key, but I try to give keys the same semantic meaning.

fzf is prefered for building interfaces

# Principles
* simplicity is a feature
    * simplicity is robustly encapsulated complexity, not a lack of features
    * know when to stop adding features (still figuring that one out)
* speed is a feature
* consistency is a feature
    * portability is consistency across platforms
    * stability (provided by maintainability) is consistency through time
    * robustness is consistency of behavior
        * behavior is everything from available commands to keybindings to terminal/OS integration
    * be explicit about the One True Wayâ„¢ and try to stick to it.
* provide rich context
    * careful of visual clutter
    * don't always indicate expected or default state
    * don't be misleading
    * providing search semantics is a great way to make context available
    * cli context includes
        * what happened and what's about to happen (history and completion)
        * who, what, where, when, why (user, command output, directory, timestamp, comments)

# Installation
1. for the full OS, scripts in `iso/` can create a custom install drive.
2. for work computers:
    * `git -C ~/my/toombs-caeman/dotfiles clone https://github.com/toombs-caeman/dotfiles`
    * `echo "PATH=\"\$PATH:~/my/toombs-caeman/dotfiles/bin\"" >> ~/.zprofile`


# Potential new stuff
* [atuin](https://atuin.sh/) magic search history
* [k](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k) - better ls
* [mosh](https://mosh.org/) or [eternal terminal](https://eternalterminal.dev/)
    * rrc
    * [xxh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh)
* a 'media repository' for stuff that doesn't fit in git well?
    * treerat
        * ricer - configuration
* email/rss as a transport protocol
    * [social media on top of rss](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33975082)
* bookmark / cache / rss / scraper tool
    * merge and manage bookmarks and cached content
    * keep a shallow cache of bookmarked websites in case they disappear
      * search for dead links
      * update cache from the wayback machine if necessary
    * allow annotations
    * cron to ping sites that regularly update and send a notification
    * generate a local rss feed from subscriptions and new content
    * pull new bookmarks from chrome / firefox
      * use folders/tags to trigger extra actions

# TODO

  * [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
  * needs bi-directional notifications in case something breaks

    * sink needs to notify if drive has failed, or has many bad sectors (maybe smartmontools)
    * very occassionally, notify that everything is working
* media
  * bookmark cache
* note other programs (but don't include in base installation)
    * krita blender godot android-studio ardour8
