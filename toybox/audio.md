I'd like to play around with the fundamentals of audio synths

# v0.1
I want to draw a bezier curve (of a single waveform)
and then play that tone. (choosing the fundamental frequency separately).

# v0.2
I want to draw an envelope and then trigger notes

# parametric ambience
for use as a soundboard while GMing ttrpgs.
'Performance' with the tool should be just a few button presses, and not annoying for 10-30 minutes without any input.

'writing songs' with this tool could be setting up chord structures or variations on a theme and saving those to presets.

parameters:
* vibe - tense, calm/chill, weird, morning coffee, evening campfire, moonlit
    * maybe calm/tense and time of day?
* environment - forest, beach, ocean, cavern, steppe, tavern, mausoleum, church, valley, mountain, town.
    * built environments maybe should have genre tags (medieval, steampunk, modern, scifi)
* weather - rain, thunder, wind, etc.
* clutter - how much stuff is going on, is the environment mostly empty or really full (are people constantly talking in your tavern, or is it mostly empty? how many crickets in your moonlit forest?)
* identity - identifiable melodic variations on themes for named locations

features:
* presets - save collections of parameters
* separate melodic/environmental volumes
* transitions
    * cut to more intense audio (strong hit) but fade back to calmer vibes? cut vs fade in/overlap, smooth tempo transitions
    * door sounds when moving from inside to outside, etc.
    * soft 'mute' button to wind down music and start back up
* sound board - environment specific cued audio buttons
* super simple performance UI
    * select presets to show
    * parameter sliders
