#           Fate Core
    An RPG where a potent character narrative empowers the dice,
    and the dice are used to resolve narrative conflict.
| +8 |Legendary| * Aspect: a detail significant to the story. you may invoke an aspect by
| +7 |Epic     |   describing how it benefits the action you wish to take. Best when clearly
| +6 |Fantastic|   phrased & double edged (could be good or bad depending on circumstance).
| +5 |Superb   | * Boost: a temporary aspect that disappears when invoked
| +4 |Great    | * Fate points: earned by having your aspects invoked against you,
| +3 |Good     |   being compelled, or conceding. Spend to invoke an aspect, refuse a compel,
| +2 |Fair     |   power a stunt, or declare an aspect. Begin each session with fate points
| +1 |Average  |   greater than or equal to your Refresh.
| +0 |Mediocre | * Skills: categories of actions your character may take. Rated by the
| -1 |Poor     |   ladder of adjectives to the left.
| -2 |Terrible | * Stunts: alter the way skills grant bonuses in specific circumstances
When taking action, decide what you want to do, then consider the table of actions below.
When called to roll, add all your dice to the appropriate skill rating. the difference between
the modified roll and its target (opposition) is a number of 'shifts'. After rolling, 
you may spend fate points to invoke aspects. add 2 shifts to your roll or re-roll for each invoke.

|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
Freely move one zone per turn (unless obstructed) and take one action.

========================================================================================

When you are 'hit', you must offset the shifts of that hit or be taken out
Your Stress Track can receive shifts, and clears at the end of a conflict.
Consequences are harder to get rid of, and can be invoked against you.
You have one slot each for mild, moderate, and severe consequences:
| -2|mild    | roll +2,4, or 6 respectively to start recovery                           |
| -4|moderate| starting recovery renames a consequence and removes it after one session.|
| -6|severe  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -8|extreme | re-write an aspect, permanently changing who you are as a person.        |



# character creation
Tells the history of a PC and sets the stage for their participation in the next part of the story.
1. begin with a name, high concept & trouble. The high concept is a personal identity like a title, job, role, etc.
The trouble is something major which draws the PC into inevitable drama/conflicts, like a personal flaw or problematic relationship.
2. write a 2-3 sentence adventure from the PCs past and derive an Aspect from it
3. Write an adventure with another player about how their PC helped or interfered with
   something you did. Derive another aspect.
4. Repeat step 3 with someone else.
5. pick skills 
    * 1 great, 2 good 3 fair and 4 average. the rest are mediocre. OR start with 20 skill points. The price of a skill is its level. You cannot have more skills at a certain rank than you have at the rank below. The skill cap is +4.
    * physique & will affect physical and mental stress. ≥+1 gives one extra and ≥+3 gives two. at ≥+5 you also gain an extra mild consequence slot (for that type of stress only).
    * initiative in physical conflicts is determined by notice (athletics, physique), in mental conflicts empathy (rapport, will)
                                                                                       {stress}
* provoke  | lore       | crafts | fight | contacts | deceive | [empathy | rapport   | {will} ] initiative
* burglary | investigate| drive  | shoot | resources| stealth | [notice  | athletics | {physique}] initiavive

6. pick 3-5 stunts. Your refresh is 3, -1 for every stunt over 3. You must have >0 refresh.
    * stunts are special traits that change the way skills work for a character. They are more powerful, but also more restricted.
        * allow a skill to power an action it usually couldn't (backstab: use stealth to attack if unnoticed)
        * add a bonus like an aspect (+2 for each refresh spent)
        * alter rules (riposte: choose to hit for 2 shifts instead of boosting when succeeding on a defense)

*step 2-6 can be completed during regular play. skip step 2-3 and pick at least a +4 skill*

# advancement


# GM notes
World creation: collectively determine the broad strokes of the setting and the scale at which your 
game takes place. The world should allow PCs to be proactive, competant and dramatic.
Derive 2-4 current & impending issues as Aspects of the world which reflect this setting & scale.
Further derive a few important locations, groups or people in relation to the world aspects.

advancement: milestones occur at the end of scenarios and story arcs
* minor: recover moderate consequences and choose 1: swap rank of two skills, replace an average skill with another, purchace a new stunt with refresh, exchange stunts, rename any aspect except high concept.
* significant: all benefits of minor plus one skill point or recover severe consequences
* major: all benefits of significant plus one refresh, recover extreme consequence, rename high concept, break skill cap

using 2d6 works in a pinch, but has a flatter (≤±2 less likely) and wider (±5 possible)
probability distribution, which is less consistent than 4 fate dice. The d6 must be distinguishable.

start scenes 30 seconds before the action starts and end them when interest flags.

Call for a roll when succeeding or failing could both contribute something interesting to the game.
If failure is boring, just give it to the players.
If success is boring, compel the players instead of rolling.

Never let the rules get in the way of what makes narrative sense.
Players should decide what they're trying to do, then consult the rules.
Anything can have aspects, stunts, stress, and consequences.

use round timers

zoom in and out, time and space is wibbly

compel: offer the players a fate point in order for something to go terribly wrong with
  one of their aspects.
  * whenever simply succeeding at a skill roll would be bland
  * whenever any player has one or no fate points
  * whenever it springs to mind
there's room to negotiate, so make it clear when a compel is 'set' and there's no backing
out without paying.


common extras:
* weapons/armor would adjust shifts on a success or tie (instead of a boost).
  Attacker receives boost if armor reduces hit to 0. recommend asymmetry.
* weather: sunny/hot☼, snow/cold ❄, clear, fog 🌫, rainy/gentle 🌧, thunder or magic storm ☈
* in your setting magic/high-tech may require specific aspects or skills as a 'permission'
  to use them, but otherwise act as traditional stunts, weapons, etc.
* mysterium vision cards as clarvoyance?
* you can treat everything in the game as an entity. Anything can have aspects, stunts, stress, and consequences.
  This includes vehicles, pets, gods, magic, spirits, natural disasters
  setting specific extras can 
* tales by the campfire: draw a card, the kind of story depends on the suit, love pain loss gain.
  worth a fate point. rewards pure roleplaying.
* epic death: go out in a blaze of glory and get a bonus to creating the next character.
