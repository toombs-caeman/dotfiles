# rummikub
number tiles, could easily be a double deck of cards though

# ideas
* miniatures with embedded magnets in the base, use poker chips (with metal inserts) as player identifiers
* 3d printed meeples and chits, get standard color filaments
* blank playing cards are cheap
* each player tableau could also be a box/storage insert
* oragami minifigures

## moonlighter
* loot phase
    * delve together, split resources?
    1. announce how deep you will delve, this is the number of dice you must keep
    2. roll #d6 equal to your level and choose which dice to keep
    3. you must have a round of combat for every 1 that you keep + 1 for every stage you delve above your level.

* combat phase
    * if you lose, lose a level
    * if you win, gain a level, once per turn
    * the first enemy encountered on the final level is the dragon

* market phase
    * you may sell resources but not buy them from the market
    * you may buy, sell, or trade artifacts
        * if multiple people wish to buy an artifact from the market, hold an auction with the minimum price as the market price

#card effects
* loot: set aside some of your dice and re-roll the rest. you cannot re-roll a 1
* combat: +1 roll
* gain a level

# ttrpg sans dice?
why are dice the default conflict resolution method in ttrpgs?
Could other minigames be interspersed in role playing?
gambling with in-game currency in the tavern?
chess representing a battle at a high level?


# plug&play ttrpg
it seems like various rpg systems 'borrow' mechanics from each other, but there is a core
a highly asymmetric cooperative game

core:
    * rewards for good role-play
    * conflict resolution
    * progression
    * description/simulation/interaction with the
    * what 'moves' are available to the players/gm

practically, it is imperative to not 'split the party', so often the PCs must be of the same social class, working as a party.
the players are all 'adventurers' (aka mercenaries, with no underlings), but what if the party wants to primarily be merchants, or generals commanding an army, or thirsty sword lesbians?

Is there a 'meta-rpg' that allows integrating the mechanics to support all of these, but which deftly elides whatever the players aren't interested in at the moment?
